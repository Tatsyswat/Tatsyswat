- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tatsyswat
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new knowledge and pushing my boundaries. 
My background of programming is limited with introduction to Python and some statistics course during college years. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to search/organize financial information on the internet. 
My current goal is to create a tool that will allow me to analyze financial information daily with one click.
Other goal is to be able to integrate the public knowledge to create efficient workflow for those in need.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TBU
- 📫 How to reach me.. TBU
